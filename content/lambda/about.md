LAMBDA is a hobby group in IIT Gandhinagar, which primarily deals with Programming Languages and related topics, with a focus on more of theoretical aspects. It was initiated through a proposal to the student senate of IITGN by me in October 2023. Our overarching goals are to -

1.  spread awareness of PLT and related topics on the IITGN campus.
2.  stay in touch with the current research in PLT and related fields.
3.  keep in touch with people working in PLs and related field across India.
4.  conduct meaningful projects which should at the very least, advance the understanding of the students involved with them.

Its current members are -

-   Aniket Mishra (That's me!)
