# Introduction

Hello! My name is Aniket Mishra, and welcome to my website. I am a BTech student in IIT Gandhinagar, who joined the college in 2023. I post about the stuff I do in my __blog__ below, check them out! You can have a look at [my CV]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/My_CV.pdf). If you want to get in touch, feel free to reach out through my email <23110026@iitgn.ac.in>. (I know it looks esoteric, it is the institute assigned email ID and I have not gotten around to changing it yet.)
