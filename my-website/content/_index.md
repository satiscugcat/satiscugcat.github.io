Welcome to my website! I am Aniket Mishra, currently pursuing my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science at IIT Gandhinagar. I am an upcoming intern for [Cryspen](https://cryspen.com/), who I will work with to extend and improve the [hax Rust verification framework](https://github.com/cryspen/hax). I also currently lead [LAMBDA]({{< relref "lambda/about">}}), a group/club in IIT Gandhinagar that is focussed on PL Theory and related fields. You can find my CV (along with other contact information) [here](/moderncv.pdf).
