## Welcome to my Blog!

Hi! This is the first day of the existence of this website and this is the first blog on it. This December, I will be attending many cool CS Theory things. In order of occurence, they are

- [IIT Delhi Winter School on Formal Verification and Program Synthesis](https://priyanka-golia.github.io/WinterSchool24/index.html) (3rd - 6th)
- [IITD Winter Residency Program, Investigations into Automated Theorem Proving and Verification](https://cstheory.iitd.ac.in/winter-residency/projects.html) (9th - 13th)
- [FSTTCS 2024, IIT Gandhinagar](https://www.fsttcs.org.in/2024/) (14th - 22nd)

I will be using this blog to record all the stuff I learn during these programs. I hope to have a lot of fun, and enjoy a lot of learning :D! So stay tuned if you're interested.
