# Day 1 #

## Talk by Prof Sanjam Garg on his Research Journey

We began the day with a presentation by [Prof. Sanjam Garg](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sanjamg/) of UC Berkeley and alumnus of IITD, about his learnings as a researcher, titled **"Your Research Career"**. (His presentation largely drew fron ["You and Your Research" by Richard Hamming](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html)). 

For him, the main motivating question for cryptography has been, "What is Possible?", how can you encrypt, how can you work with encrypted data, etc. Success over the past two decades has included FHE, Obfuscation, etc. However, following success, it becomes necessary to move into newer directions (quantum computers, real world needs, practical efficiency), constantly asking, "What is Possible?". Now, how does one make progress in answering that question? For him, the most important question a researcher should ask themselves is "What are the most important problems in my field?". At the end of the day, a researcher is responsible for their own career, their advisor is just their advisor. The question of what an important problem is thus something every researcher should ask for themselves, considering various variable factors such as location, timespan, etc.

He emphasises that it is important not to fear. Fear may prevent a reseacher to take on important problems, expecting to waste time, however, most important problems see significant progress in a decade. It's thus important to have courage to work consistently on things that one thinks are difficult and important. He backed his words by showing a lisit of open problems he had jotted down a decage ago. Open problems to which no approach existed at the time which he wrote them. However, most of them turned out to either be solved or have significant progress in the next decade, winning best paper awards in STOC, EUROCRYPT, and CRYPTO. Once a researcher has chosen a problem, he feels that it is important that they take that problem as something to guide them. It is important to find smaller goals to guide oneself to that bigger problem, working persistently in small (publishable steps), working on new techniques and seizing the opportunity when those ideas mature.

He emphasises that it is very important to **communicate technical ideas clearly**. If this is not done, then any results obtained from one's work are prone to be forgotten, giving way for a future researcher to work on the same problem and publish their work again, all because they couldn't understand your work. Communication also allows one to get feedback from other people, letting one get gain new perspectives on the topic. Talking to people a lot is in general something that helps, not only in solving problems, but also in finding opportunities for further exploration. While doing good research is important, it's also good to have fun along the way.

Summary on how to research well
- What is the most important problem of my field?
- Why don't I work on it? If someone will solve it in the next decade?
- Can I make the tiniest progress on this problem?
- Can I expand it to an interesting paper?
- If not, revisit anytime you find a new technique to attack the problem
- The more you work, the bigger the compounding effect
